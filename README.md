# Behat quick start
Behat allows doing [Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) in PHP, and it's considered a semi-official [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/) 
implementation. I followed [this tutorial](https://docs.behat.org/en/latest/quick_start.html) to learn how it 
works. 
The first 
commit is the feature written in [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/), and the ones that follow are the
baby-steps I took to implement the feature using the BDD/TDD approach.
